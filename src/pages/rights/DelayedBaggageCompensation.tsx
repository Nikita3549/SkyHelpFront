      <h2>Your Rights When Airlines Mishandle Your Baggage</h2>
      <p>
        Having your luggage delayed, damaged, or lost can significantly impact your trip. Fortunately, international 
        agreements protect passengers whose baggage is mishandled. This guide explains your rights and how to claim 
        compensation for baggage-related issues.
      </p>

      <h3>Legal Framework: The Montreal Convention</h3>
      <p>
        Unlike flight delays and cancellations, which are governed by EU Regulation 261/2004, baggage issues are primarily 
        covered by the Montreal Convention. This international treaty applies to most international flights and establishes 
        airline liability for baggage problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the Montreal Convention, airlines are liable for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Delayed baggage</li>
        <li>Damaged baggage</li>
        <li>Lost baggage</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The maximum compensation is currently set at approximately 1,288 Special Drawing Rights (SDR) per passenger 
        (approximately â‚¬1,500 or $1,780, though exact amounts fluctuate with exchange rates).
      </p>

      <h3>Types of Baggage Issues and Your Rights</h3>

      <h4>1. Delayed Baggage</h4>
      <p>
        If your baggage doesn't arrive with your flight, you're entitled to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reimbursement for essential items (toiletries, clothing, etc.) that you need to purchase while waiting for your luggage</li>
        <li>Assistance from the airline in locating and delivering your baggage</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Most airlines consider baggage "delayed" for up to 21 days. After this period, it's typically declared "lost."
      </p>

      <h4>2. Damaged Baggage</h4>
      <p>
        If your baggage or its contents are damaged during transport, you're entitled to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Repair of the damaged items</li>
        <li>Replacement of items that cannot be repaired</li>
        <li>Compensation for the depreciated value of damaged items</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Important: You must report damaged baggage within 7 days of receiving it.
      </p>

      <h4>3. Lost Baggage</h4>
      <p>
        If your baggage is declared lost (typically after 21 days), you're entitled to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Compensation for the value of your lost baggage and its contents (up to the convention limits)</li>
        <li>Reimbursement of any baggage fees you paid</li>
      </ul>

      <div className="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-4">
        <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">Important Time Limits:</h4>

      <h3>Maximizing Your Compensation Claim</h3>

      <h3>Airline Liability Limitations</h3>

        <li>Airlines typically won't compensate for fragile or perishable items</li>
        <li>High-value items like electronics, jewelry, or cash may not be fully covered</li>

        <li>There's a maximum liability cap (approximately 1,288 SDR)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For particularly valuable items, consider carrying them in your cabin baggage or purchasing additional insurance.
      </p>

      <p>

        appropriate compensation. Remember that airlines have a legal obligation to assist you with baggage problems, and
        you have the right to fair compensation for the inconvenience and financial impact caused by delayed, damaged, or lost luggage.
